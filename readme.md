# Typing Speed Test with Finger Position Hints
This project is a **Typing Speed Test** designed to help users practice typing and improve their typing speed and accuracy. The test provides visual hints for which **hand** and **finger** to use, as well as the **row position** of the key on the keyboard (top row, home row, or bottom row).

### How to Run

1. **Open the Test**:
   - Open [Typing Test](https://quantqi.github.io/TestTyping/) in any modern web browser.

2. **Start Typing**:
   - The test will begin automatically. Follow the hints and type the characters displayed.

## Features

- **Random Characters**: The test displays random characters, including numbers, special characters, and the "Space" key.
- **Finger Hints**: Arrows indicate whether the character should be typed using the left (`←`) or right (`→`) hand, and a number below the arrow indicates which finger to use. Finger numbers are based on standard typing conventions:
  - **1**: Index finger
  - **2**: Middle finger
  - **3**: Ring finger
  - **4**: Pinky finger
- **Position Arrows**: Additional arrows (`↑` and `↓`) indicate whether the key is located on the top row, home row (no arrow), or bottom row of the keyboard.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: The test provides real-time feedback on your typing speed (**Characters per Minute**) and **accuracy**.
- **Final Results**: After 5 minutes, the test will display your final speed and accuracy.
- **Customizable Test Duration**: Users can now set the test duration to their preference.
- **Pause and Resume**: The test can be paused and resumed at any time.
- **Progress Tracking**: Track your progress over time with detailed statistics and history.
- **Configurable Keys**: Users can configure the keys on the keyboard to match their preferences.
- **Privacy**: No analytics are collected. All your data is saved in cookies, which can be easily deleted from the config section.

## Rules to Follow

1. **Start the Test**:
   - Upon opening the test in your web browser, it will begin automatically.
   - Type the character displayed on the screen. Once typed correctly, the next character will appear.

2. **Typing Guidelines**:
   - **Hand Arrows**:
     - If a **left arrow (`←`)** is shown, use your **left hand**.
     - If a **right arrow (`→`)** is shown, use your **right hand**.
   - **Finger Numbers**:
     - The number below the arrow indicates which finger to use.
     - **1** is the thumb, **2** is the index finger, and so on, up to **5** (pinky).
   - **Row Position**:
     - The **up arrow (`↑`)** means the key is in the top row.
     - No arrows mean the key is in the home row.
     - The **down arrow (`↓`)** means the key is in the bottom row.

3. **Typing Special Keys**:
   - **Space**: Press the spacebar when "[Space]" is displayed on the screen.
   - Other special keys such as "Enter", "Backspace", and "Esc" are not implemented in this exercise and are represented as simple characters.

4. **Real-Time Feedback**:
   - The test tracks the number of characters you type correctly, your typing speed in **Characters per Minute (CPM)**, and your **accuracy** as a percentage.

5. **Finish the Test**:
   - The test lasts for 5 minutes by default. After that time, the test will automatically end and display your final CPM, accuracy, and total time elapsed.
   - If you have set a custom duration, the test will end after the specified time.

6. **Pause and Resume**:
   - You can pause the test at any time by clicking the "Pause" button.
   - To resume, click the "Resume" button.

7. **Track Your Progress**:
   - Detailed statistics and history of your typing tests are available to help you track your progress over time.
